# Robinson-neural-mass-simulations
This repository contains code to simulate the Robinson neural mass model (stochastic delay differential equation)


We refer to https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.65.041924 and https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhj072 for details of the model. 

Examples of model simulations during an absence seizure, a tonic-clonic seizure, and a resting state are provided.
